That door is almost always closed.

I'm from \u003Cem\u003ENigeria\u003C/em\u003E and I've witnessed how \u003Cem\u003Etech\u003C/em\u003Enology cycles tend to work here.\u003Cp\u003EIn America and the West, the \u003Cem\u003Etech\u003C/em\u003Enology markets are efficient enough for incremental innovation to be viable enough for a new product. That's not the case in Africa (I can only speak for Africa, not the developing world).\u003Cp\u003EWe don't innovate incrementally but we take massive leaps between commoditized \u003Cem\u003Etech\u003C/em\u003Enology. we need to build a stronger internet backbone that will give developers an active Internet market to cheaply test new products. it will be difficult for us to incrementally innovate otherwise.",
