OPV use was curtailed after VAPP was discovered.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, if not blatantly false, at least utterly misleading. The NIH \u003Ci\u003Edid\u003C/i\u003E conduct trials to determine the safest form of oral polio vaccine, roughly ten years after it was introduced, largely because there\u0026#x27;s nobody, including me, who wants to see people get sick from a vaccine or anything else for that matter. The implication that the government scrambled to reformulate the vaccine in response to adverse events is absurd, and the 1960 formulation, still imperfect, is in use today:\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EOutbreaks of VAPP occurred independently in Belarus (196566), Canada (196668), Egypt (19831993), Hispaniola (20002001), Philippines (2001), Madagascar (20012002),[48] and in Haiti (2002), where political strife and poverty have interfered with vaccination efforts.[49] In 2006 an outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus occurred in China.[50] Cases have been reported from Cambodia (20052006), Myanmar (20062007), Iran (1995, 20052007), Syria, Kuwait and Egypt.[51] Since 2005, The World Health Organization has been tracking vaccine-caused polio in northern Nigeria caused by a mutation in live oral polio vaccines.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do of course have to keep these numbers in perspective.

Immunodeficiency essentially means that a child cannot be vaccinated, as the purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate the immune system. Immunodeficiencies other than AIDS are not widespread in the developing world, nor are they generally a result of malnutrition, but you are of course correct that it is improper to vaccinate an \u003Ci\u003Eimmunodeficient\u003C/i\u003E child with any vaccine, OPV or otherwise! Agammaglobulinemia is, I assure you, not caused by poor nutrition.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EIf you\u0026#x27;re the sort of person who thinks a pharmaceutical company makes a favorable comparison to a \u0026quot;benevolent nonprofit organization\u0026quot;\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can show that it is true for a benevolent entity, then it follows \u003Ci\u003Ea fortiori\u003C/i\u003E for GSK.

The misinformation you attempt to spread is dangerous, and while you have every right to claim it, people have the collective right to be informed that your arguments are weak and your conclusions incorrect.

Did you even look at the Google results?\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EOr consider that my recollection of the details was mistaken slightly. OPV use was curtailed after VAPP was discovered.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, if not blatantly false, at least utterly misleading. The NIH \u003Ci\u003Edid\u003C/i\u003E conduct trials to determine the safest form of oral polio vaccine, roughly ten years after it was introduced, largely because there's nobody, including me, who wants to see people get sick from a vaccine or anything else for that matter. The implication that the government scrambled to reformulate the vaccine in response to adverse events is absurd, and the 1960 formulation, still imperfect, is in use today:\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EOutbreaks of VAPP occurred independently in Belarus (196566), Canada (196668), Egypt (19831993), Hispaniola (20002001), Philippines (2001), Madagascar (20012002),[48] and in Haiti (2002), where political strife and poverty have interfered with vaccination efforts.[49] In 2006 an outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus occurred in China.[50] Cases have been reported from Cambodia (20052006), Myanmar (20062007), Iran (1995, 20052007), Syria, Kuwait and Egypt.[51] Since 2005, The World Health Organization has been tracking vaccine-caused polio in northern \u003Cem\u003ENigeria\u003C/em\u003E caused by a mutation in live oral polio vaccines.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do of course have to keep these numbers in perspective. VAPP remains rarer than terrorism.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EAs long as you aren't a starving waif in some developing country (or a starving waif from the US). From the Wiki: In immunodeficient children, the risk of VAPP is almost 7,000 times higher\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA gross misrepresentation of life in developing countries,  of the meaning of the term \u0026quot;immunodeficiency\u0026quot;, and the causes of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiency essentially means that a child cannot be vaccinated, as the purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate the immune system. Immunodeficiencies other than AIDS are not widespread in the developing world, nor are they generally a result of malnutrition, but you are of course correct that it is improper to vaccinate an \u003Ci\u003Eimmunodeficient\u003C/i\u003E child with any vaccine, OPV or otherwise! Agammaglobulinemia is, I assure you, not caused by poor nutrition.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EIf you're the sort of person who thinks a pharmaceutical company makes a favorable comparison to a \u0026quot;benevolent nonprofit organization\u0026quot;\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can show that it is true for a benevolent entity, then it follows \u003Ci\u003Ea fortiori\u003C/i\u003E for GSK.

The misinformation you attempt to spread is dangerous, and while you have every right to claim it, people have the collective right to be informed that your arguments are weak and your conclusions incorrect.
