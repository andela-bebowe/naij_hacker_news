On Monday, the titles available on the company\u0026#x27;s US site included Bernardo Bertolucci\u0026#x27;s 1970 classic The Conformist, and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, by Chan-wook Park. Occasionally, it features more mainstream movies like Sin City, currently available on the French site, though the majority are far more obscure.

Like, really, \u003Ci\u003Eyou cannot be serious\u003C/i\u003E. I provide three examples. You ignore the two [bathtubs, aspirin] that don\u0026#x27;t fit the pattern you want to make up (one for three isn\u0026#x27;t very good), where said pattern is \u0026quot;vaccines preventable, accidents not\u0026quot;, and you further ignore that being struck by lightning is obviously preventable by, e.g., staying indoors, and while this isn\u0026#x27;t \u003Ci\u003Eperfect\u003C/i\u003E the vast majority of lightning strikes do in fact occur outside. So your use of lightning is wrong, and it is yet insufficient to support the greater point you are making, which is also wrong.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EMost people take various levels of precaution against those risks, yet many will just let anyone in a lab coat jab them without hesitation. Fine for them, fine for you, but don\u0026#x27;t expect me to fall in line without more information.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, but wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle but not while riding a motorcycle is a clear sign of insanity, is it not? The level of concern ought to be at least somewhat proportionate to the risk, yet the degree to which certain people attend to the risks of vaccines is anything but commensurate with the level of attention given to the risks of poor diet, lifestyle, driving, sports, over-the-counter drugs, alcohol etc.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EWhat do you think of the Japanese, who are relative \u0026quot;vaccine deniers\u0026quot;[2] yet somehow miraculously have the longest life expectancy anywhere on the planet?[3]\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Japanese do not vaccinate for diseases which do not exist in Japan. They do, however, vaccinate for Japanese encephalitis, whereas the US does not -- guess why. Vaccine schedules in most countries are designed to attack the most prevalent diseases in that country; nowhere are they designed to provide lots of spurious vaccinations for profit.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EWhat is absurd and damaging to society is the persistent obfuscation and non-disclosure of clinical trial data, and the failure to conduct proper non-rigged trials.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour allegations that trials are \u0026quot;rigged\u0026quot; is without basis. As I\u0026#x27;ve explained below, your claims that the trials were \u0026quot;rigged\u0026quot; is a result of your failure to understand the effect size in question, that being the incidence of VAE linked to LYMErix. However, saying that clinical trials are \u0026quot;rigged\u0026quot; without any evidence therefor \u003Ci\u003Eis\u003C/i\u003E absurd.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EThere is widespread doubt (among people who pay attention) about the system that is supposed to ensure peoples\u0026#x27; safety.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_words\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ehttp:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;en.wikipedia.org\u0026#x2F;wiki\u0026#x2F;Weasel_words\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EVaccine court doesn\u0026#x27;t protect companies when they knowingly or maliciously harm people, my mistake.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour \u0026quot;mistake\u0026quot; was posting this godawful response.

Furthermore, you allege things which you have not shown -- \u0026quot;knowingly or maliciously harm people\u0026quot; -- there is no evidence of malice here on the part of GSK, and by the time HLA-DR4+ was properly identified, the vaccine was being withdrawn from the market.\u003Cp\u003EIt is indeed a good thing that these people are able to recover compensation from the government. It would be wrong to leave them out in the cold. It is a silly criticism that the rewards are paid by the government rather than the company, as the goal is to provide adequate care to people adversely affected by public health efforts, not to discourage the development of vaccines by private industry.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EFact is, you don\u0026#x27;t know if that is true or not.

OPV use was curtailed after VAPP was discovered.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, if not blatantly false, at least utterly misleading. The NIH \u003Ci\u003Edid\u003C/i\u003E conduct trials to determine the safest form of oral polio vaccine, roughly ten years after it was introduced, largely because there\u0026#x27;s nobody, including me, who wants to see people get sick from a vaccine or anything else for that matter. The implication that the government scrambled to reformulate the vaccine in response to adverse events is absurd, and the 1960 formulation, still imperfect, is in use today:\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EOutbreaks of VAPP occurred independently in Belarus (196566), Canada (196668), Egypt (19831993), Hispaniola (20002001), Philippines (2001), Madagascar (20012002),[48] and in Haiti (2002), where political strife and poverty have interfered with vaccination efforts.[49] In 2006 an outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus occurred in China.[50] Cases have been reported from Cambodia (20052006), Myanmar (20062007), Iran (1995, 20052007), Syria, Kuwait and Egypt.[51] Since 2005, The World Health Organization has been tracking vaccine-caused polio in northern Nigeria caused by a mutation in live oral polio vaccines.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do of course have to keep these numbers in perspective. VAPP remains rarer than terrorism.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EAs long as you aren\u0026#x27;t a starving waif in some developing country (or a starving waif from the US). From the Wiki: In immunodeficient children, the risk of VAPP is almost 7,000 times higher\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA gross misrepresentation of life in developing countries,  of the meaning of the term \u0026quot;immunodeficiency\u0026quot;, and the causes of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiency essentially means that a child cannot be vaccinated, as the purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate the immune system. Immunodeficiencies other than AIDS are not widespread in the developing world, nor are they generally a result of malnutrition, but you are of course correct that it is improper to vaccinate an \u003Ci\u003Eimmunodeficient\u003C/i\u003E child with any vaccine, OPV or otherwise! Agammaglobulinemia is, I assure you, not caused by poor nutrition.\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Ci\u003EIf you\u0026#x27;re the sort of person who thinks a pharmaceutical company makes a favorable comparison to a \u0026quot;benevolent nonprofit organization\u0026quot;\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can show that it is true for a benevolent entity, then it follows \u003Ci\u003Ea fortiori\u003C/i\u003E for GSK.
